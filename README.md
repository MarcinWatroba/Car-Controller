# Car-Controller
A* based car controller that has been modified to reduce the amount of waypoints and improve track completition time.

The framework system called “Applying EANNs” used for
this project has been downloaded from GitHub site
belonging to Samuel Arzt, initial system had neural
networks algorithm applied to control vehicles, however,
the AI was removed, and own artificial intelligence has
been applied. Other parts of the system responsible for
creating cars, tracks and UI have been left as they were.
